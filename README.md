# CRYPTOKEYZPROJECT

My Idea for this project is to turn it into a game where players can fight battles with/collect digital objects called Keys.
For now the project has only implemented the collectible aspect for the sake of My Smart Contract Essentials course, but I will be completing it in its entirety.
