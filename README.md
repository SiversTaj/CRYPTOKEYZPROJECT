# CRYPTOKEYZPROJECT

My Idea for this project is create a game where players can fight battles with/collect Non-fungible digital objects called Keyz.
For now the project has only implemented the non-fungible collectible aspect for the sake of My Smart Contract Essentials course, but I will be completing it in its entirety.
